# Flock

A Rust implementation of the **Flock** proving system: a prover and verifier for
R1CS-over-GF(2) statements, built on a zerocheck + lincheck PIOP with a
multilinear PCS (Ligerito / BaseFold) over the binary field F₂₁₂₈. Tuned for
Apple silicon (M-series).

It ships end-to-end provers for hash-chain and Merkle-path statements over
BLAKE3, SHA-256, and Keccak-f[1600].

## Layout

Two crates, split along the prove/verify boundary:

- **`crates/flock-core`** — the protocol library and verifier (field arithmetic,
  NTT, zerocheck, lincheck, PCS, Merkle, R1CS). Carries everything needed to
  verify; portable, with scalar fallbacks for the NEON kernels.
- **`crates/flock-prover`** — the end-to-end prover: prove orchestration, the
  hash R1CS encoders, the hash-chain / Merkle-path statements, and the
  `flock_chain` CLI. Depends on `flock-core` and re-exports it.

The heavy NEON kernels live in the shared `flock-core` layer, so the verifier
runs on the same code as the prover; `flock-core` still compiles off-ARM via the
scalar fallbacks.

## Build

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo test --release
```

Requires a recent stable Rust toolchain (edition 2024). All optimizations target
`aarch64-apple-darwin`; the code compiles on other targets but the NEON paths are
gated to ARM64.

## CLI — hash-chain prover

```sh
cargo build --release -p flock-prover --bin flock_chain

# Prove an 8-step BLAKE3 chain:
cargo run --release -p flock-prover --bin flock_chain -- prove \
    --hash blake3 --steps 8 --out /tmp/chain.bin

# Verify:
cargo run --release -p flock-prover --bin flock_chain -- verify --in /tmp/chain.bin
```

`--hash` accepts `blake3`, `sha2`, or `keccak`. `--steps` must be a power of two
≥ 8. Run `flock_chain help` for the full flag list (`--mode`, `--backend`, …).

## Benchmarks

There are no Criterion harnesses; each bench is a no-harness binary that prints
its own table. Run one with:

```sh
cargo bench --bench blake3_proof
cargo bench --bench e2e_zerocheck
```

Always run benches **one at a time** — concurrent benches contend for cache,
memory bandwidth, and thermal headroom on a single chip. See
[`benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`](benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md) for the full set and the
competitor comparisons.
